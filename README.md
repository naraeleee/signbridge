# Sign Bridge


Sign Bridge is a user-friendly web application that's all about making American Sign Language (ASL) easy and fun to learn, while also offering a handy translation feature. We designed it with a big goal in mind: to shatter language barriers and create a stronger, more inclusive bond between the deaf and hearing communities.

At the heart of Sign Bridge is an innovative, real-time Sign Language Recognition model. This means you can hop onto the Webcam Quiz feature and practice your ASL signs right there and then. It's interactive, engaging, and a great way to get hands-on experience. Plus, you'll be learning in a way that sticks, thanks to the immediate feedback and fun challenges.

But that's not all. Sign Bridge also doubles as a translator, bridging the gap between spoken and sign language. Whether you're learning ASL, teaching it, or just want to communicate more effectively with the deaf community, Sign Bridge is your go-to tool. It's more than just an app â€“ it's a step towards a more inclusive world.
